# SX126x Ping Pong example

## Description

The application will automatically set the device in Ping-Pong mode.

The sample code will be used to perform test for both LoRa and FSK modem tests. Define macro `PACKET_TYPE` to `SX126X_PKT_TYPE_LORA` or `SX126X_PKT_TYPE_GFSK` (in file (`../../common/apps_configuration.h`)) to enable each modem in the test.

The application can make device work as master or slave in Ping-Pong test. When starting up, it assumes to be a master and will send 'PING' packets and receive 'PONG' packets alternatively. When a 'PING' packet received, the device switches itself to slave mode, then send 'PONG' packets and expect to receive 'PING' packets. In slave mode, if the device receive a 'non-PING' packet, it will reset to master mode and start the previous process again.

## Configuration

Several parameters can be updated in `../../common/apps_configuration.h` header file, refer to `../../common/README.md` for more details.

Several parameters can be updated in `main_ping_pong.h` header file:

| Constant           | Comments                    | Default value                | Default value |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| `RX_TIMEOUT_VALUE` | timeout value for reception | Any value that fits uint32_t | 600           |

When compiling with arm-none-eabi-gcc toolchain, all these constant are configurable through command line with the EXTRAFLAGS.
See main [README](../../../README.md).
